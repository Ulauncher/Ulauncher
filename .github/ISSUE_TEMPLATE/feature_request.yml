        Thanks for taking the time to suggest improvements to Ulauncher! Please keep these requests short and to the point, but be as thorough as needed with the technical details. Be aware that we might move the request to our [GitHub Ideas Discussions](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/discussions/categories/ideas) if we feel it needs more feedback from the community, more time, or more implementation details before we are ready to consider it as an "actionable" task.
